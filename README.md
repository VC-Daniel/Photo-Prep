Photo Prep is an Android app written in Kotlin. Photo Prep is a tool to help photographers prepare for photo shoots by enabling users to create dynamic checklists for their photo shoot locations. These checklists dynamically show prep based on the weather and subjects of the user's next photo shoot.
